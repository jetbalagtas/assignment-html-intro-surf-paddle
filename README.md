## Description
As a developer on the web, you will sometimes be tasked with creating an html page simply from an image file.  In this assignment, I turned this image below into a functioning website.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

* Understand the proper use and function of html tags.
* Understand and leverage the many CSS properties to style content.
* Use CSS to create layout for the HTML page.

### Performance Objectives

* Use sectioning html tags.
* Effectively utilize some common CSS layout strategies (float or inline-block).
* Leverage and understand the use of `absolute` vs `relative` in context of positioning.
* The menu items need to also have differing states based on a hover, and although not articulated in the provided image, they need to be styled.

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `index.html`
  * 'styles.css'
  * 'images/'

## Normal Mode

Using the image located `assets/surf-and-paddle.png`, create a functioning HTML page to look like below:
